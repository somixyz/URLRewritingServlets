# URLRewritingServlets

In URL rewriting, we append a token or identifier to the URL of the next Servlet or the next resource. 
We can send parameter name/value pairs using the following format: 
--->url?name1=value1&name2=value2&??

In this example, we are maintaning the state of the user using link. For this purpose, we are appending the name of the user in the query string and getting the value from the query string in another page.
